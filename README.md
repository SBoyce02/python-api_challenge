Observable trends based on WeatherPy data

As we expected, the dataset I pulled showed that the closer to the equator the warmed the temperature and the further away you got the cooler the temperatures started to get. 
Before the data I also assumed that humidity and latitude would have a strong relationship but there does not appear to be a relationship or much of a correlation no matter which hemisphere you are in. The cloudiness has no relationship with latitude but it would be interesting to see if there is any relationship for the longitude since it seems weather systems tend to move west to east.
